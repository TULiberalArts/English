    Katherine Henry earned her Ph.D. at Rutgers University in 1997, and taught at the Ohio State University, Newark campus, before coming to Temple in 2004. She specializes in early and antebellum American literature and rhetoric, with a particular interest in republican and liberal models of citizenship. Her work considers the contours of civic life from the early national period to the Civil War, the development of an American mythology, and the ways in which U. S. citizenship is contested at its boundaries. Her current book project is tentatively titled “Ghosts of Liberty: Civic Unrest and the Philadelphia Gothic, 1820-1855.” A recipient of the Eleanor Hofkin Award for Excellence in Teaching, Henry teaches undergraduate English and American Studies courses (including the first half of the American Literature Survey) and graduate English courses.

  bio: >
    Dr. Friedman heard the siren call of satire early in her academic career, and has devoted herself to its study ever since. Her undergraduate college applications, filed in a distant era when a request for one’s reading list of the past year was a common element, featured an enthusiastic catalogue of the complete works of Dorothy Parker, James Thurber, Robert Benchley, S.J. Perelman, and 65 novels by P.G. Wodehouse. Critic Ihab Hassan may have decreed that literary fiction “now makes [language] the center of its reflexive concern, and explodes in ludic, parodic, ironic forms” but he could just as well have been referring to Dr. Friedman’s own bookshelves. She received a Thomas J. Watson research fellowship upon completion of her B.A. at Bryn Mawr to research suffrage-related theater and contemporary women’s political theater in the UK, Italy, and Morocco. She spent 18 months and her entire award on theater tickets and festivals, and taking playwrights and directors for drinks in pubs. When the fellowship ended she neglected to return home, and spent the next 12 years in London, writing radio satire, working in theater, and teaching literature at Goldsmiths College, University of London. Now resident in Philadelphia, Dr. Friedman continues to publish and present her work on satire, genre theory, postcolonial writing, and the Beat Generation, at both local and international conferences.

Goldblatt works both as a composition/literacy researcher and as a creative writer. His first research book, Round My Way: Authority and Double Consciousness in Three Urban High School Writers (University of Pittsburgh Press, 1995), focused on the individual writer and institutional sponsorship, but in recent years he has published on community-based learning and literacy autobiography.
