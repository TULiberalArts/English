Temple’s Department of English faculty are especially strong in modern literature and cultural studies. We also offer training in all historical periods of British and American literature and Anglophone literature. Faculty research interests include critical theory, cultural studies, gender studies, minority literatures, visual and spatial studies. Faculty expertise also covers areas where literature intersects with history, non-print media, philosophy, psychology and the arts.
