Templeâ€™s distinguished Department of English faculty are especially strong in modern literature and cultural studies, but we offer training in all historical periods of British and American literature and Anglophone literature. Faculty research interests cover a wide spectrum, including critical theory, cultural studies, gender studies, minority literatures, visual and spatial studies. In addition, they cover areas where literature intersects with history, non-print media, philosophy, psychology and the arts.
