## Study English in Philadelphia
Literature, the practice of writing, and the analysis of language foster attentiveness and mental agility by presenting us with complex perspectives on social and artistic movements, historical events, cultural phenomena, and communication patterns.
 
## Why Study English?
Powerful, persuasive writing, sharp analytic skills and creative, flexible thinking are essential abilities for tomorrow’s leaders and professionals. The English major cultivates these abilities through the study of the literatures, language, and cultures of the United States, Britain, the English-speaking world, and beyond.
