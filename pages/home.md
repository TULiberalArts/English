The Department of English teaches students to read and write with clarity, precision and imagination by exploring linguistic practices and literary traditions in Britain, the United States and the English speaking world — with added attention to film, video and photography.

English majors and minors acquire analytical and writing skills that can support a wide range of careers in cultural, financial and governmental institutions, as well as non-government and non-profit organizations. A concentration in English can not only lead to advanced study in English literature and other academic fields, but can also prepare students to enter arts and public administration, business, law and politics, where their skills stand to make a difference.
