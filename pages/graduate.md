## Earn Your MA or PhD in English
Temple University's MA and PhD programs in English offer students the advantages of the resources of a Research I institution in an energetic urban environment. Both the MA and PhD programs in English provide options for intensive study in critical theory, cultural theory, film theory, interdisciplinary methods, minority literature and women’s studies. Traditional areas of study include Renaissance, eighteenth-century, nineteenth-century, modern and contemporary literature, as well as rhetoric and composition. Students are encouraged to engage in serious interdisciplinary projects and work closely with a faculty member engaged in research and publications projects that take them regularly into the arts, history, non-print media, philosophy and psychology. We are affiliated with the Association of Departments of English (ADE) and the Modern Language Association (MLA).

## MA in English
If you want to earn only a master's degree or you want to explore education at the graduate level before you commit to a PhD program, the Department of English offers an MA in English program. Temple's graduate programs in English enjoy are highly regarded for teaching and research in both traditional and innovative areas of literary history and literary criticism. The MA in English program provides options for intensive study in critical theory, cultural theory, film theory, interdisciplinary methods, minority literature, and women’s studies. Graduates from our MA program find employment in high schools or preparatory schools, in editing or publishing, or as professional writers. Others go on to doctoral study at Temple and other institutions.

## PhD in English
Temple's PhD in English program features faculty teaching a wide range of courses in all historical periods of British and American literature, Anglophone literature, and critical and cultural theory. The program is especially strong in 19th and 20 century studies.  It also emphasizes training in Composition and Rhetoric. Graduates with a PhD typically go on to careers in college teaching and related fields. Foundational courses provide the broad background needed for independent research, while our advanced graduate classes allow students to engage with cutting-edge faculty research. Special topics courses cover Feminist Rhetoric of Science, Joyce and Lacan, Literary Aesthetics, Photography and Literature, Fetishism and the 19th Century Imagination, Transatlantic Feminist Theory and Queer Poetry and Poetics.  

Following course work, students generally choose a concentration in one or two of our main areas of strength, each of which will prepare them to teach and do research in the field:   British Literature; American Literature; Postcolonial and Global Literatures; Ethnic and African American Literatures; Literature and Visual Studies; Critical and Cultural Theories; Poetry and Poetics;  Gender and Sexuality; Composition and Rhetoric.

## Study Abroad in Rome
The Rome Seminar in Art and Culture is offered in the Summer term at Temple University's Rome campus, the Villa Caproni. This 6-credit graduate seminar is designed to bring together the disciplines of aesthetics and cultural studies. In its interdisciplinary thrust, the seminar is intended to serve as a foundation for advanced study in the human sciences and to reflect the most current trends of thought in post-modern culture. Applications are welcome from advanced undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students in fields such as art, film studies, literature, philosophy, and social theory. The seminar entails an intensive program of classwork, field trips, and guest lectures. The city of Rome is used extensively as a resource. Accommodations are available in a Temple student Residenza or through student-arranged living accommodations in advance. All classes are taught in English.

## Graduate English Association

The organization conducts regular monthly meetings, and its purpose is to make recommendations to the faculty on departmental issues (instructor training, program changes, etc.) and to enrich the graduate experience with developmental workshops and social events.
