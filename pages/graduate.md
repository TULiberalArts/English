## Earn Your MA or PhD in English
Temple University's MA and PhD programs in English offer students the advantages of the resources of a Research I institution in an energetic urban environment. Both the MA and PhD programs in English provide options for intensive study in critical theory, cultural theory, film theory, interdisciplinary methods, minority literature and women’s studies. Traditional areas of study include Renaissance, eighteenth-century, nineteenth-century, modern and contemporary literature, as well as rhetoric and composition. Students are encouraged to engage in serious interdisciplinary projects and work closely with a faculty member engaged in research and publications projects that take them regularly into the arts, history, non-print media, philosophy and psychology. We are affiliated with the Association of Departments of English (ADE) and the Modern Language Association (MLA).

## MA in English
If you want to earn only a master's degree or you want to explore education at the graduate level before you commit to a PhD program, the Department of English offers an MA in English program. Temple's graduate programs in English enjoy are highly regarded for teaching and research in both traditional and innovative areas of literary history and literary criticism. The MA in English program provides options for intensive study in critical theory, cultural theory, film theory, interdisciplinary methods, minority literature, and women’s studies. Graduates from our MA program find employment in high schools or preparatory schools, in editing or publishing, or as professional writers. Others go on to doctoral study at Temple and other institutions.

## PhD in English
Temple's PhD in English program features faculty teaching a wide range of courses in all historical periods of British and American literature, Anglophone literature, and critical and cultural theory. The program is especially strong in 19th and 20 century studies.  It also emphasizes training in Composition and Rhetoric. Graduates with a PhD typically go on to careers in college teaching and related fields. Foundational courses provide the broad background needed for independent research, while our advanced graduate classes allow students to engage with cutting-edge faculty research. Special topics courses cover Feminist Rhetoric of Science, Joyce and Lacan, Literary Aesthetics, Photography and Literature, Fetishism and the 19th Century Imagination, Transatlantic Feminist Theory and Queer Poetry and Poetics.  

Following course work, students generally choose a concentration in one or two of our main areas of strength, each of which will prepare them to teach and do research in the field:   British Literature; American Literature; Postcolonial and Global Literatures; Ethnic and African American Literatures; Literature and Visual Studies; Critical and Cultural Theories; Poetry and Poetics;  Gender and Sexuality; Composition and Rhetoric. Our PhD in English takes anywhere from 5-7 years to finish, depending on whether you already have an master's degree and whether you have fellowship support, teaching responsibilities and other factors.

## Study Abroad in Rome
The Rome Seminar in Art and Culture is offered in the Summer term at Temple University's Rome campus, the Villa Caproni. The interdisciplinary seminar serves as a foundation for advanced study in the human sciences and reflects the most current trends of though in post-modern culture. Graduate and post-doctoral students in literature, film studies, philosophy, art and social theory are welcome to apply. The seminar, taught in English, entails an intensive program of class work, field trips and guest lectures and uses the Rome extensively as a resource.

## English PhD Job Placement
In recent years, 40% of our PhDs have found work in tenure-track positions, another 24% in non-tenure full time teaching. In addition, 15% are working in non-teaching position for which a PhD serves as a qualification. While some PhDs find work immediately upon graduating, it’s not uncommon for recent graduates to hold positions as adjuncts for one or more years before securing a full-time position. Our graduates tend to find jobs in the Northeast, demonstrating the enriching effect of Temple's English graduate program on the region. However, our PhDs also take jobs outside the region in state that include California, New York, Ohio and Wisconsin.
