## Graduate Overview of Programs

The Ph.D. program features faculty teaching a wide range of courses in all historical periods of British and American literature, Anglophone literature, and critical and cultural theory. The program is designed to give students a solid grounding in the methods of literary study and a broad perspective on literary production and meaning. The program balances theoretical sophistication with historical scope and methodological variety. The Literature faculty is strong in traditional areas of literary scholarship with concentrations in criticism, literary forms and periods, cultural studies, rhetoric and composition. Our aim is to produce students who will write publishable dissertations and pursue productive careers as scholar-teachers. In addition to challenging course work, students receive attentive mentoring from individual faculty members assigned to entering students in their first semester. Course work is usually completed in two to three years. The dissertation is expected within six years. The program requirements include completion of course work (14 courses), written and oral preliminary exams, and completion and defense of the dissertation.

For students who are unclear about their desires to enter the doctoral program, we offer a two-year, 30-credit M.A. program. In pursuit of the M.A. degree, students will take a range of courses grounding them in traditional literary periods and theoretical approaches to literature. The M.A. culminates in a qualifying paper developed out of course work. Temple M.A.s in English find employment at the high school or preparatory school, in editing or publishing, or as professional writers; they also go on to doctoral study at Temple and other institutions.

Our M.F.A. degree in Creative Writing is a two-year, 33-credit program in either fiction or poetry. The Creative Writing faculty includes nationally recognized writers in poetry, fiction, and nonfiction. The writing component features small, intensive workshops, supplemented by one-on-one tutorials and courses in literature and the craft of writing. The program culminates in a thesis. Temple M.F.A.s in Creative Writing find employment as writers, teachers, publicists, writing consultants, or publishers; they also go on to doctoral study in English or other disciplines.

** Reapplication**

- Applicants to the graduate programs are not invited to reapply for admission once they have been rejected.

**Transfer Credits**

- Students who have earned graduate credits or a Master’s degree at another institution can transfer a maximum of 15 credits toward the course work requirement for the Ph.D.

## M.A. in English

The Department of English houses a terminal master’s degree in English for students who wish to earn only an M.A. degree or who wish to explore education at the graduate level before committing to a Ph.D. program. At any point in the M.A. program, a student may apply to the Ph.D. program. If accepted, all credits earned would be transferable. Funding is not ordinarily available for this degree.

For the master’s degree in English, students complete a total of 30 credits by taking 27 credits of course work (9 courses), including at least one advanced-level seminar, plus 3 credits of Masters Essay (9996). A maximum of six graduate credits can be transferred from another program. Students must also write one qualifying paper while enrolled in Masters Essay (9996), typically a substantial revision of a paper submitted for a course, and demonstrate reading knowledge of one foreign language.

For more details on the M.A. program, visit the [Graduate Policies and Procedures](http://www.cla.temple.edu/english/graduate/policies-and-procedures/) page.

## How to Apply

###  About Creative Writing

The Temple M.F.A. Creative Writing Program awards a two-year Master’s of Fine Arts degree in English-Creative Writing, with a focus in either fiction or poetry. Our innovative curriculum immerses students in the study of creative writing and literature, with course offerings that range from special topics and craft classes in creative writing to graduate seminars in literature. Through small workshops each semester and one-on-one manuscript tutorials with our resident faculty in the second year, the curriculum supports students as they gain technique and self-confidence and prepare to hand in their MFA theses in their final semester. The supportive environment also helps our students move successfully from the MFA into the highly competitive world of submissions to journals and book publishers.

Workshops are supplemented by individual consultations with visiting writers-in-residence and a series of readings by prominent writers. For more information, please look at our Poets & Writers events page. Students also have the opportunity to work on our online literary journal, [Tinge Magazine](http://www.tingemagazine.org/) which is graduate student-edited.

Faculty who have taught in the program in the past include such noted writers and scholars as David Bradley, Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Pattie McCarthy, Toby Olson, Sonia Sanchez, Susan Stewart, and William Van Wert. Current faculty include Samuel R. Delany, Don Lee, Joan Mellen, Jena Osman, Alan Singer, and Brian Teare. The program also hosts a visiting fiction writer and a visiting poet each year; visitors have included Peter Carey, Alexander Chee, Robert Creeley, Robert Coover, Anita Desai, Brian Evenson, C.S. Giscombe, Jaimy Gordon, Mat Johnson, Bhanu Kapil, Jonathan Lethem, Carole Maso, Anne Waldman, C.D. Wright, and Alice Notley, and many others. Please click here to apply!

Please go to the Temple University Creative Writing M.F.A. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/templecreativewriting) page for current updates.

### How to Apply

We prefer that applicants to the M.F.A. Program in Creative Writing hold a bachelor’s degree in English or have taken a significant number of credits in English and American literature. Exceptions are made if applicants can demonstrate the ability to take graduate-level literature courses. We consider the entire application package in our admission decisions.

The minimum admission standard for all graduate students is an undergraduate grade point average of “B” or 3.0 (see bottom of page for exceptions), or the functional equivalent for students who have attended universities outside of the United States.

Submit the following general application materials and supporting materials to be considered for admission. Please note that the Creative Writing Program uses Interfolio for supporting materials, although other options are available, as described farther down this page. All materials must be submitted online and/or postmarked by February 1. If you would like to be considered for a fellowship or a teaching assistantship, please turn in your materials (including the recommended GRE scores) by December 15.

### GENERAL APPLICATION MATERIALS

**Graduate School Application:** Complete the general Graduate School application on [Temple’s online Banner system](http://www.temple.edu/grad/admissions/howtoapply.htm). (There is an option on the website to download a paper application, which should be mailed to: Creative Writing Program, Dept. of English (022-29), Temple University, Anderson Hall, Room 1020, 1114 Polett Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19122-6090.)
Graduate Record Examination (GRE): Scores are not required to apply to the MFA Creative Writing program; however, if you wish to be considered for a fellowship or a teaching assistantship, you are strongly encouraged to take the GRE and to have your scores for the general test forwarded electronically by ETS to Temple University by December 15.

**International applicants:** TOEFL, IELTS, or PTE scores should be sent to Temple University electronically by ETS or the appropriate agency. The following minimum scores are required: TOEFL score of 79/550, or IELTS score of 6.5, or PTE Academic score of 53. Please refer to the Graduate School’s international application [page](http://www.temple.edu/grad/admissions/international.htm).

**Transcripts:** Two copies of all transcripts must be submitted, one official copy by mail, and one unofficial copy electronically. Request that official transcripts from all institutions of higher education previously attended (including Temple, as well as institutions from which you did not receive a degree) be mailed to: Creative Writing Program, Dept. of English (022-29), Temple University, Anderson Hall, Room 1020, 1114 Polett Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19122-6090. We ask that you also scan and upload copies of all your transcripts to your Interfolio account and submit them with the other application materials (see next section). These can be unofficial or student copies of transcripts.

### Supporting Materials

The following required materials should be submitted electronically through the Interfolio online dossier service. (There is a $19 fee on Interfolio to establish a dossier account. If you wish to avoid this fee, scroll down for other options.) For instructions on how to create an Interfolio account and submit all the additional applications materials as one package, see “Interfolio Instructions” below.

**Financial Aid Application:** Fill out the financial aid application [form](http://www.cla.temple.edu/english/files/2016/10/FAApp2.pdf) (PDF) if you are interested in being considered for a fellowship or assistantship, then send the form through Interfolio. (This PDF form has fillable fields that may be completed on your computer.) In addition, you must submit a C.V. or resumé through Interfolio if applying for financial assistance. See our Financial Aid page for eligibility information.

Transcripts: Send scans of unofficial or student copies of all transcripts through Interfolio (refer to “General Application Materials” above).

**Personal Statement (750–1,000 words):** Send a personal statement through Interfolio. Give us a sense of who you are—a more detailed, personal picture than what can be gleaned from transcripts or résumés, especially if you have a non-traditional background or atypical undergraduate record. Discuss literary influences and models that feed your creative work; we’re interested in which writers and texts have been important to you, as well as what critical approaches you have found useful. Describe your teaching experience if you have any. Mention what attracts you to Temple’s program and/or Philadelphia. Double-space the lines, paginate the pages, use a standard font such as Times New Roman sized to 12 points, and have margins of at least one inch on all sides. (You will be required to post a personal statement on the online Banner system for the general Graduate School application. Although it may seem redundant, please send a copy as a separate document.)

**Sample of Written Work:** Your writing sample is probably the most crucial single element of your application. Through Interfolio, send a packet of writing in one genre only (poetry or fiction). For poetry, submit ten pages. These pages may include shorter poems, longer poems, and/or an excerpt from a longer project. Individual poems should be separated by page breaks, not run together. Poems may be single-spaced or formatted in whatever way you see fit. For fiction, send a total of 20–25 pages. Double-space the lines, paginate the pages, use a standard font such as Times New Roman sized to 12 points, and have margins of at least one inch on all sides. For applicants in either genre, if you would like to include a critical essay in addition, please feel free to do so; it should be double-spaced and formatted like the fiction sample.

**Three Letters of Recommendation:** Request signed, confidential letters of recommendation through your Interfolio account. After your letters have been uploaded by your evaluators to your Interfolio account, you will be able to send them electronically to us without seeing their contents. If done through Interfolio, your evaluators do not need to also send papers copies of their letters by mail. Your recommendations should address the specific projects you have undertaken in your previous academic and creative career. They should therefore be written by people who have worked closely with you on literary or related projects, and/or supervised your teaching. In most cases, these will be faculty members. We review the letters of recommendation for specific information about how you write, how you approach problems, how you work in the classroom (both in workshops and in literature courses).

In addition, we may request a personal or phone interview with you at a later time.

### Interfolio Instructions

Please use Interfolio’s dossier service, which accepts files ranging from PDFs to Word documents, to collect and submit application materials. (There is a $19 fee on Interfolio to establish a dossier account. If you wish to avoid this fee, see below for other options). 

- Create or log in to your Interfolio dossier account at interfolio.com/services/dossier.
- Request signed, confidential letters of recommendation from your three evaluators through your Interfolio account.

### Options Other Than Interfolio

If you do not wish to use Interfolio, you may send your supporting materials to us either by emailing a PDF or by delivering printouts via regular mail.

**Emailing a PDF:** Combine your supporting materials into one PDF in this order: financial aid [application](http://www.cla.temple.edu/english/files/2016/10/FAApp2.pdf)(PDF), C.V. or résumé, unofficial copies of all transcripts, personal statement, and writing sample. If needed, use the free [pdfmerge.com](http://www.pdfmerge.com/) service or another utility to produce a single PDF. Email the PDF to [creatwrt@temple.edu](creatwrt@temple.edu).

However, you must have your three evaluators mail their letters of recommendation directly to us on official letterhead, with their signatures across the seals of the envelopes. These letters should be mailed to the address below. Somewhere on the front of the envelope, please have the evaluator write “MFA Recommendation for,” followed by your full name. Note that you must still submit the general Graduate School application on the [online Banner system](http://www.temple.edu/grad/admissions/howtoapply.htm) (or through the paper option), have your GRE scores (and, if applicable, your TOEFL, IELTS, or PTE scores) sent to us electronically by ETS or the appropriate agency, and have official transcripts mailed to us by the institutions to the address below. See the requirements above in “General Application Materials.”

**Exceptions for GPAs less than 3.0**

The Dean of the Graduate School considers exceptions to the admissions requirement if the student meets one of these criteria:

- Scored above the 65th percentile on the verbal and quantitative portions of the Graduate Record Exam (or other standardized test, such as the Graduate Management Admission Test).
- Earned a 3.5 grade point average during her/his final two years of undergraduate work.
- In special circumstances, particularly with an exceptional writing sample, other exceptions may be granted.

## Ph.D. in English

The Department of English houses a doctoral program to which applicants with a B.A. can be admitted directly, that is, without first earning a master’s degree. Applicants are required to declare an intention to proceed toward the Ph.D., although they can still receive an M.A. along the way or choose to stop at the M.A. The Department also accepts applications to the doctoral program from applicants who have earned an M.A. elsewhere.

For information on how to apply to the Ph.D. program, please visit the [Graduate Bulletin](http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/cla/english-phd/#admissiontext).
