## Earn Your MA or PhD in English
Temple University's MA and PhD programs in English offer students the resources of a Research I institution in an energetic urban environment. Both the MA and PhD programs provide options for intensive study in critical theory, cultural theory, film theory, minority literature and women’s studies. As a graduate student at the Department of English, you are encouraged to work closely with faculty and engage in serious research and publication projects. Temple's graduate programs in English are highly regarded for teaching and research in both traditional and innovative areas of literary criticism and history. We are especially strong in 18th century studies, 19th century studies and we emphasize training in composition and rhetoric. The department is affiliated with the Association of Departments of English (ADE) and the Modern Language Association (MLA).

Please visit the [English Graduate Admissions page](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/admissions/graduate/english) to learn more about graduate program requirements, dates and deadlines and instructions on how to apply.

## MA in English
If you want to earn only a master's degree or you want to explore education at the graduate level before commiting to a PhD program, the Department of English offers a two year MA in English program. MA Graduates find employment in high schools or preparatory schools, in editing or publishing, or as professional writers. Others go on to doctoral study at Temple and other institutions. Funding is usually reserved for PhD students.

## PhD in English
Graduates with a PhD typically go on to careers in college teaching and related fields. Foundational courses provide the broad background needed for independent research, while our advanced graduate classes allow you to engage with cutting-edge faculty research. Our special topics courses have recently covered the following subjects. 

- Feminist Rhetoric of Science
- Fetishism and the 19th Century Imagination
- Joyce and Lacan
- Literary Aesthetics
- Photography and Literature
- Transatlantic Feminist Theory
- Queer Poetry and Poetics

Following course work, you will choose a concentration in one or two of our main areas of strength, each of which will prepare you for teaching and research in the field. Our main areas of strengh are listed below (see listings with faculty at the bottom of the page).

- American Literature
- British Literature
- Critical and Cultural Theories
- Ethnic and African American Literatures
- Gender and Sexuality
- Literature and Visual Studies
- Poetry and Poetics
- Postcolonial and Global Literatures

A PhD in English at Temple takes anywhere from 5-7 years to finish, depending on whether you already have an master's degree and whether you have fellowship support, teaching responsibilities and other factors.

## Study Abroad in Rome
The Rome Seminar in Art and Culture is offered in the Summer term at Temple University's Rome campus, the Villa Caproni. The interdisciplinary seminar serves as a foundation for advanced study in the human sciences and reflects the most current trends of thought in post-modern culture. Graduate and post-doctoral students in art, film studies, literature, philosophy and social theory are welcome to apply. The seminar, taught in English, entails an intensive program of class work, field trips and guest lectures and uses Rome extensively as a resource.

## English PhD Job Placement
In recent years, 40% of our PhDs have found work in tenure-track positions. Another 24% have found work in non-tenure full time teaching. In addition, 15% are working in non-teaching positions for which a PhD serves as a qualification. While some PhDs find work immediately upon graduating, it’s not uncommon for recent graduates to work as adjuncts for one or more years before securing a full-time position. Our graduates tend to find jobs in the Northeast, demonstrating the enriching effect of Temple's English graduate programs on the region. However, PhDs also take jobs outside the region in states that include California, New York, Ohio and Wisconsin.

## Admission Requirements
As an applicant to our graduate programs in English, you should have the equivalent of an undergraduate concentration in English with broad chronological coverage of literature or have completed equivalent coursework. Successful applicants also have a strong record of academic achievement. When applying to Temple, you must declare whether you plan on earning your master's or doctorate. However, PhD students may choose to stop at the master's degree. As an MA you may choose to apply for the PhD program, and all your credits are transferable. Funding is available to eligible PhD candidates in the form of University Fellowships, Future Faculty Fellowships and Teaching Assistantships. The deadline for applications is **December 15** for students applying for funding (i.e. teaching fellowships). **We accept applications until February 15.**

Please visit the [English Graduate Admissions page](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/admissions/graduate/english) to learn more about graduate program requirements, dates and deadlines and instructions on how to apply.
