## Study Abroad in Rome
The Rome Seminar in Art and Culture is offered in the Summer term at Temple University's Rome campus, the Villa Caproni. This 6-credit graduate seminar is designed to bring together the disciplines of aesthetics and cultural studies. In its interdisciplinary thrust, the seminar is intended to serve as a foundation for advanced study in the human sciences and to reflect the most current trends of thought in post-modern culture. Applications are welcome from advanced undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students in fields such as art, film studies, literature, philosophy, and social theory. The seminar entails an intensive program of classwork, field trips, and guest lectures. The city of Rome is used extensively as a resource. Accommodations are available in a Temple student Residenza or through student-arranged living accommodations in advance. All classes are taught in English.

## Prerequisites for Admission to the M.A. and Ph.D. Programs
To be accepted into the M.A. or Ph.D. programs, a student should have the equivalent of an undergraduate concentration in English with broad chronological coverage and a strong record of achievement. Applicants are required to declare their terminal degree at the time of application, although Ph.D. students can choose to stop at the Master’s degree.

## Application Process

1. **Begin by applying online to Temple University Graduate School:** 
[http://www.temple.edu/apply/common/appcheck.asp](http://www.temple.edu/apply/common/appcheck.asp). You can track your application using the nine digit TUid number issued to you once you have submitted your application, along with the PIN number you receive.  You will need your ID number and PIN in order to log onto the system.

2. **Submission of Supporting Materials: Supporting materials can be submitted in several ways.**

3. Interfolio: [http://www.interfolio.com](http://www.interfolio.com) (See note below on using Interfolio).
4. Submit in a single PDF file attached to an email to eng1grad@temple.edu.
5. Materials can also be mailed as hard copy to:

Department of English (022-29)

3. **Assembling your application:**
**3A. Test Scores:** Please make sure that you schedule the GRE and LITERATURE subject exam (for PhD and MA in Literature) as soon as possible so that your scores will be received by the December 15th deadline.  Your GRE scores (and TOEFL scores if required) should be sent to Temple University electronically by ETS. Scores are good for five years from date of test. Foreign applicants: TOEFL scores (minimum score 620).

**3B.** Transcripts: Two copies of all your transcripts must be submitted, one official copy by mail, and one unofficial copy electronically.

- Request that official transcriptsfrom all institutions of higher education previously attended (including Temple, as well as institutions from which you did not receive a degree) be mailed to the Temple University Department of English at the mailing address above.

**3C. Three (3) letters of recommendation** from persons in a position to evaluate your past work, as well as your ability to do graduate work in literary history and  criticism.  Request signed, confidential letters of recommendation from your evaluators through your Interfolio account or have them mailed or emailed directly to us. (See above for addresses.) We suggest you waive the right to see the letter.

**3D. Personal Statement:** Please send through Interfolio a copy of the Personal Statement from your online application, or include in your PDF or mailed application. The Personal Statement (500 to 800 words) should discuss your research interests and your interest in the English graduate program at Temple University, your career goals, and your academic and research achievements, if applicable.

**3E. Writing Sample:** A sample essay in literary criticism or rhetorical analysis for literature applicants is required. Again, submission via Interfolio, or PDF, or US mail.

**3F. A current Curriculum Vitae (CV)**.

**3G. Transfer Credits:** Students who have earned graduate credits or a Master’s degree at another institution can transfer a maximum of 15 credits toward the course work requirement for the Ph.D. Transfer credit applications are received after the student arrives on campus, although you are welcome to inquire regarding eligibility during the application process.

**3H. Other information:** A personal interview is not required, but may be requested. A student with deficiencies in any area may apply for admission. Such a student may be admitted to a degree program with the provision that one or more courses be taken in addition to the normal requirements. Applicants to the graduate programs are not invited to reapply for admission once they have been rejected.
