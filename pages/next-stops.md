Take your pick! Employers look for people who can think both critically and creatively. The BA in English at Temple — with its emphasis on both creative and critical scholarship - prepares students for success in careers in the academic, corporate and non-profit sectors and beyond. From mayoral campaigns to musicology, recent Temple grads are putting their English degrees to work in many careers and fields. English majors are prepared for careers that involve writing or editing - whether the subject matter is an advertising campaign, an essay, a grant proposal, a legal document or a website. English majors also find non-writing and editing careers in fields that include business, education, government, law, librarianship, marketing and social services. 

The Department of English also offers a popular career seminar that introduces students to working professionals with backgrounds in English who work in rewarding and relevant fields that include blogging, comics, non-profit leadership and publishing. All offer valuable resources for students hoping to break into these careers and more. We also have a well-established internship program that offers English majors a wealth of opportunities to work in the real world while still working toward a degree. Recently, English majors have secured internships at organizations that include the following. 

- Philadelphia Museum of Art
- Wilma Theater
- Philadelphia Magazine
– US Department of Labor
- Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia
- American Cancer Society
