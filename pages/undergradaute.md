## Major in English at Temple
A BA in English not only prepares you for graduate-level study in English literature and other academic fields, but also prepares you for careers in fields that include advertising, business, education, law and government. English majors become critical and reflective readers, aware of the history and development of writing in English. They are also strong, inventive writers who are able to analyze problems, do careful and innovative research, argue and evaluate the arguments of others. Courses in the English Department explore past and present
artistic, literary, linguistic, and social movements and their aftermaths. Learn about topics that range from Shakespeare in movies to depictions of race in literature from distinguished and internationally renown faculty. Like all undergraduate programs in the College of Liberal Arts, majoring in English teaches you how to think creatively and critically, solve problems and cultivate social intelligence.

## Certificate in Writing
The Writing Certificate option allows students enrolled in Temple programs to focus their attention on the skills and theory of writing. Because it is not a degree program, the Writing Certificate is only available to matriculated Temple students who are already pursuing an undergraduate degree with the university. Students earn the Certificate by receiving an average of B or above in five of the writing courses listed below, including at least one from each of the three certificate areas: **Advanced Expository and Professional Writing, Creative Writing, and Writing Theory**. See programs details and course requirements in the [Undergraduate Bulletin](http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/liberal-arts/english/certificate-writing/.) 

Students interested in the Writing Certificate are urged to seek advice on their goals and course choices from Professor Eli Goldblatt, at [eligold@temple.edu](mailto:eligold@temple.edu).

## Creative Writing Concentration 
English majors with an interest in Creative Writing should consider a Creative Writing concentration. Such a concentration will allow for focused study of a particular genre and will provide good preparation for those students interested in graduate study in Creative Writing. **(LINK TO NEW CREATIVE WRITING UNDERGRAD PAGE ON CREATIVE WRITING PROGRAM PAGE)**

## English 1801: Career Seminar
The career seminar is a one-credit course designed to provide English majors with resources and support to help them make informed decisions about career development and other professional opportunities. The course aims to provide students with the opportunity to meet a range of English majors who can discuss what they have done with their training in the liberal arts, to become familiar with the skills employers are looking for, to revise and edit cover letters and resumes, and to develop a strategy for employment.
