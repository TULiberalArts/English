## Major in English at Temple
A BA in English not only prepares you for graduate-level study in English literature and other academic fields, but also prepares you for careers in fields that include advertising, business, education, law and government. English majors become critical and reflective readers, aware of the history and development of writing in English. They are also strong, inventive writers who are able to analyze problems, do careful and innovative research, argue and evaluate the arguments of others. Courses in the English Department explore past and present artistic, literary, linguistic, and social movements and their aftermaths. Learn about topics that range from Shakespeare in movies to depictions of race in literature from distinguished and internationally renown faculty. Like all undergraduate programs in the College of Liberal Arts, majoring in English teaches you how to think creatively and critically, solve problems and cultivate social intelligence.

## Minor in English
The Minor in English is an excellent way to extend the breadth of your education and experience the rich history of English, American and global literature. Whether you plan to become a lawyer, a scientist or a doctor, minoring in English helps you develop strong analytical thinking and writing skills. As a result, the English minor gives you better leverage in the job search or in graduate admissions after college. English Minors take introduction courses to English, American and Global literature in addition to a course in interpreting literature that teaches rigorous methods of literary analysis and critical thinking.

## Certificate in Writing
The Writing Certificate option allows students enrolled in Temple programs to focus their attention on the skills and theory of writing. Because it is not a degree program, the Writing Certificate is only available to matriculated Temple students who are already pursuing an undergraduate degree with the university. Students earn the Certificate by receiving an average of B or above in five of the writing courses listed on the bulletin, including at least one from each of the three certificate areas (Advanced Expository and Professional Writing, Creative Writing and Writing Theory). Students interested in the Writing Certificate should email [Professor Eli Goldblatt](mailto:eligold@temple.edu).

## Internships for English Majors

Use your writing, editing, research and verbal communication skills in professional settings, such as business, cultural institutions, government, law and non-profit organizations. Students receive credit for interning by enrolling in English 3805 - most internships are unpaid but count as academic credit. Located near Temple's main campus or in center-city Philadelphia, internships are excellent preparation for your job search post-graduation.

Although the course involves some traditional coursework, the majority of the course in completed on your professional site. As an intern you work 10 hours a week for 14 weeks or the equivalent. Additional or fewer credits are pro-rated at 47 hours total per credit. The course may be taken for 1-12 credits over several semesters.

The 1 credit course provides our students with resources designed to support career development. English majors meet alumni who discuss how they've used their training at the College of Liberal after graduation. The course familiarizes students with the skills employers look for and also offers instruction in editing cover letters, resumes and job search strategy.
