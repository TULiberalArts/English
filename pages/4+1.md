## Earn a BA and MA in Five Years
The 4+1 BA/MA in in English allows you to graduate with both an undergraduate and graduate degree in just 5 years. We designed the program for high-achieving English majors who excel during the first 3 years at the Department of English, and who seek out the added credential of a master's degree. Having an MA in English is helpful for publishing, teaching and writing positions - the 4+1 program also provides you a competitive edge when applying to PhD programs. If you are interested in the 4+1 Accelerated BA/MA degree Program, apply during your junior year.

In addition to fulfilling all the requirements for the BA in English by the end of your senior year, you must complete all requirements for the MA in English by the end of your fifth year. The complete list of requirements are listed below.

- **9 English graduate courses (27 credits)**: One of which must be at the advanced level (8000-9000)
- **3 graduate courses in the fourth or senior year**: These 3 graduate courses will substitute for 3 required courses for the undergraduate major. We recommend students take Eng 9001: Introduction to Graduate Studies or enroll in an alternate Eng 5000-7000 level course. In the spring semester, students take two courses that should also be at the 5000-7000 level. The 3 graduate courses taken senior year substitute for one of the required undergraduate 2000 level courses, and 2 of the required 3000 level courses.
- **6 graduate English courses in their fifth or MA year**
- **English 9996: Masters Essay (3 credits)**: Student work under the guidance of a faculty mentor on the Masters Qualifying Essay and submit the Qualifying Essay by the Spring semester deadline for acceptance.
- **Masters Qualifying Essay**: The Qualifying Essay is typically a substantial revision of a paper submitted for a course and is written in the final semester under the guidance of a faculty mentor, who also approves the essay for submission. The Qualifying Essay demonstrates the student’s ability to write perceptively, lucidly, and at length (4,000-6,000 words) on a literary subject, and is due in the final semester by a date specified in the Graduate English Calendar.
- **Language Requirement**: Students are required to demonstrate reading knowledge of one foreign language by either passing a translation exam or completing 6 credits of language courses beyond the intermediate language level in either the fourth or fifth year of the program.
