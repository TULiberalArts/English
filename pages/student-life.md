## Writer-in-Residence Program
The Creative Writing Program invites a distinguished novelist (in the fall) and poet (in the spring) to be in residence for several days in order to work with MFA students. These guests read student manuscripts in their genre, meet with students individually in conference, give a reading, attend graduate workshops, and spend informal time with the students over the course of their visit.

Please visit the Creative Writing MFA page for info about the [Writer-in-Residence Program](https://www.temple.edu/academics/degree-programs/creative-writing-mfa-la-crwr-mfa).

## DuPlessis Lecture in Poetry and Poetics
The DuPlessis Lecture is named after Professor Emeritus Rachel Blau DuPlessis. DuPlessis is a widely published poet and critic and one of her significant contributions to the field of poetry and poetics is her interweaving of these two practices. Her poetry often speaks to the concerns of her critical work and her critical works often stretch the conventions of the scholarly essay. This lecture series honors DuPlessis’ expansions of literary form, and features poets who write in a number of different registers.
