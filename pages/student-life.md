## Study Abroad in Rome
The Rome Seminar in Art and Culture is offered in the Summer term at Temple University's Rome campus, the Villa Caproni. The interdisciplinary seminar serves as a foundation for advanced study in the human sciences and reflects the most current trends of thought in post-modern culture. Graduate and post-doctoral students in art, film studies, literature, philosophy and social theory are welcome to apply. The seminar, taught in English, entails an intensive program of class work, field trips and guest lectures and uses Rome extensively as a resource.

## Association of Departments of English
The [Association of Departments of English](https://www.ade.mla.org/) advocates for English departments and promotes the value of English studies. As a project of the Modern Language Association, the ADE provides information and research for its member departments, creating institutional, national, and professional contexts for exploring policy, disciplinary challenges, trends, and best practices in the broad field of English studies in higher education.

## Journal of Modern Literature
The [Journal of Modern Literature](https://muse.jhu.edu/journal/97) (JML) is a journal of scholarly research covering literature written in the twentieth century and beyond. It is published four times a year, including its annual review issue which consists of approximately 250 reviews, plus thousands of listings of articles, books and dissertations that appeared during the preceding year. Temple University English professors Morton Levitt (retired) and Daniel O’Hara are two of JML’s Editors; many English faculty are on the Advisory staff. The editors welcome research-based studies of American, English and world literature published during the last century. Manuscripts should follow MLA guidelines.

## Graduate English Association
The [Graduate English Association](https://sites.temple.edu/gradenglish/about/) (GEA) is an organization for all graduate students in the English department, regardless of program (Literature or Creative Writing) or funding status (fellowship, GA, TA or otherwise). The organization conducts regular monthly meetings, and its purpose is to make recommendations to the faculty on departmental issues (instructor training, program changes, etc.) and to enrich the graduate experience with developmental workshops and social events.

## Tinge Magazine
TINGE Magazine, Temple University’s online literary journal, is usually published twice a year, in the Spring (May) and in the Fall (December). The journal is edited by the graduate students of Temple’s MFA Program in Creative Writing. The journal has an open submission policy.

## Writer-in-Residence Program
The Creative Writing Program invites a distinguished novelist (in the fall) and poet (in the spring) to be in residence for several days in order to work with MFA students. These guests read student manuscripts in their genre, meet with students individually in conference, give a reading, attend graduate workshops, and spend informal time with the students over the course of their visit.  Recent Writers-in-Residence have included Alexander Chee, Norma Cole, Craig Dworkin, Brian Evenson, C.S. Giscombe, Francisco Goldman, Jaimy Gordon, Mat Johnson, Bhanu Kapil, Tracie Morris, Peter Straub, Cole Swenson, and John Yau.

## DuPlessis Lecture in Poetry and Poetics
The DuPlessis Lecture is named after Professor Emeritus Rachel Blau DuPlessis. DuPlessis is a widely published poet and critic and one of her significant contributions to the field of poetry and poetics is her interweaving of these two practices. Her poetry often speaks to the concerns of her critical work and her critical works often stretch the conventions of the scholarly essay. This lecture series honors DuPlessis’ expansions of literary form, and features poets who write in a number of different registers.
