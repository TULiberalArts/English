### Internships

Internships are becoming an increasingly important part of an education. College graduates today find themselves in diverse workforce settings, and would benefit from hands-on experience and training that strengthen their resume and prepare for a future career. The English Department is dedicated to providing a wealth of internship opportunities for students throughout the University. Internships are made available through the English **3805** course.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Who is eligible for English 3085?**

The course is open to juniors or seniors in any major, preferably with a 2.5 GPA or higher and strong writing and language skills.

**What kinds of internships are available?**

Interns use their English language skills: writing, editing, textual analysis, research, tutoring in literacy or literature, verbal communication, in professional settings, such as publishing, law, government, cultural institutions, non-profits, business. Most internships are unpaid but carry academic credit. Most are located in center-city Philadelphia or near Temple’s campuses.

**What are the requirements?**

Students in English 3085 are required to interview for their positions, create and present current resumes and cover letters, post weekly journal entries on Blackboard, take part in online discussions with the instructor and other interns, and submit final papers evaluating the internship experience. The major part of the internship is the work done at the professional site.

**How are credits determined?**

For three credits, interns work 10 hours a week for 14 weeks or the equivalent (140 hours total). Additional or fewer credits are pro-rated at 47 hours total per credit. The course may be taken for 1-12 credits over several semesters.

**How do students find their internships?**

Securing an internship is excellent practice for a job search after graduation. After an initial interview with Professor Robison to assess their interests and options, students apply to appropriate sites, interview with interested employers, and arrange work schedules with the workplace supervisor when an internship is offered.

**How are interns registered for the course?**

Students cannot register themselves for English 3085. In order to be registered, a student who has been accepted as an intern should email Professor Robison, [prob@temple.edu](mailto:prob@temple.edu).

## Poets & Writers Series

Public readings by Recognized and Emerging Authors. 

The Poets & Writers Series is sponsored by the Temple University MFA Creative Writing Program, with the assistance of the Richard Moyer Fund. Each year a number of poets and fiction writers are invited to read from their work (usually on Thursdays) to members of both the Temple community and the local Philadelphia arts scene. Joining each invited writer is a writer from Temple’s graduate program in Creative Writing.

All events are free and open to the public. Readings are held either on the main Temple campus or the Center City Philadelphia Temple campus.

## Writer-in-Residence Program 

The Creative Writing Program invites a distinguished novelist (in the fall) and poet (in the spring) to be in residence for several days in order to work with MFA students. These guests read student manuscripts in their genre, meet with students individually in conference, give a reading, attend graduate workshops, and spend informal time with the students over the course of their visit. During the two years of the Master’s program, students will have the opportunity to engage with four of these visitors and have conferences on their work with two of them (in their specific genre). The writers brought to Temple under this program are a distinctive and internationally recognized group. Recent Writers-in-Residence have included Alexander Chee, Norma Cole, Craig Dworkin, Brian Evenson, C.S. Giscombe, Francisco Goldman, Jaimy Gordon, Mat Johnson, Bhanu Kapil, Tracie Morris, Peter Straub, Cole Swenson, and John Yau.

## DuPlessis Lecture in Poetry and Poetics

The DuPlessis Lecture is named after Professor Emeritus Rachel Blau DuPlessis. DuPlessis is a widely published poet and critic and one of her significant contributions to the field of poetry and poetics is her interweaving of these two practices. Her poetry often speaks to the concerns of her critical work and her critical works often stretch the conventions of the scholarly essay. This lecture series honors DuPlessis’ expansions of literary form, and features poets who write in a number of different registers.

## Graduate Summer Seminar: Temple Rome

### Program Overview

Temple University Rome offers a four-week graduate seminar designed to bring together the disciplines of aesthetics and cultural studies. In its interdisciplinary thrust, the six-credit seminar is intended to serve as a foundation for advanced study in the human sciences and to reflect the most current trends of thought in post-modern culture. The seminar convenes at Temple University’s campus in Rome.

The Temple Seminars in Art and Culture welcome applications from advanced undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students in fields such as literature, film studies, philosophy, art, and social theory. The seminar entails an intensive program of class work, field trips and guest lectures. The city of Rome is used extensively as a resource. The Villa Caproni overlooks the River Tiber and is located just off the Piazza del Popolo and the Borghese Gardens. Accommodations can be arranged in a Temple student Residenza or students can make their own living arrangements in advance. All classes are taught in English.

### Vision and Rationality

This topic of the seminar focuses on the troubled relation between perception and cognition in three historical moments of Western culture: the Renaissance and the birth of single point perspective; the Baroque and Counter-Reformation; and the postmodern critique of Enlightenment rationality. We speculate about how our culture has been shaped by collaboration and conflict among visual, visionary, ideological and rational ways of knowing the world. The scope of our inquiry embraces literary, philosophical, painterly and cinematic texts.

Among the questions to be raised are: What is the relation between visual and verbal representation? Is the perceptual realm of sight necessarily subordinated to rationality? What is the place of visual representation in the tug-of-war between imaginary and real spheres of being? What historical and ideological exchanges between vision and rationality continue to affect our social and political orders? What role does aesthetics play in the making of a public sphere?

## Graduate English Association

The [Graduate English Association (GEA)](http://sites.temple.edu/gradenglish/about/) is an organization for all graduate students in the English department, regardless of program (Literature or Creative Writing) or funding status (TA, GA, fellowship, or otherwise).

The organization conducts regular monthly meetings, and its purpose is to make recommendations to the faculty on departmental issues (instructor training, program changes, etc.) and to enrich the graduate experience with developmental workshops and social events.
